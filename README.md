# Tracker

Tracker is the main codebase for [@HQMonitor](//twitter.com/HQMonitor) (also known as HypeTrack), a server monitoring system for [HQ Trivia](//hqtrivia.com).

## Features

Tracker can:
* Determine when the server is being re-deployed or scaled up
* Determine when an HQ stream has gone live

* Discord webhook (set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env`)
* Telegram chat (set `TG_TOKEN` and `TG_CHAT_ID`)
* Twitter (set `TW_CONSUMER_KEY`, `TW_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `TW_ACCESS_KEY`, and `TW_ACCESS_SECRET`)
